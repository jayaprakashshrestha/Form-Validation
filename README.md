# React Form Validation Example

This is a simple React application that demonstrates form validation using React hooks. The application provides a sign-up form where users can enter their details, including first name, last name, email address, password, and confirm password. The form validates the input data and displays error messages for any validation failures.

## Installation

To run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-form-validation.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd react-form-validation`
3. Install the dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

Once you have installed the dependencies, you can start the application using the following command:

```
npm start
```

This will run the application in development mode and open it in your default browser. If it doesn't open automatically, you can access it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## How it Works

The application uses React and React hooks, specifically the `useState` hook, to manage the form state and perform validation. When the user enters data into the form fields, the `handleChange` function updates the form state accordingly. On form submission, the `handleSubmit` function validates the form data using the `validate` function and displays error messages if necessary.

The validation rules implemented in this application are as follows:

- First name and last name are required fields.
- Email address must be a valid email format.
- Password must be at least 8 characters long.
- Confirm password must match the password field.

If the form data passes all the validation rules, an alert message is shown indicating that the form is valid. Otherwise, the error messages are displayed next to the corresponding form fields.
